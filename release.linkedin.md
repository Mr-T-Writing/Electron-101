A few years ago, I shared a series called hashtag#ReedReads on Instagram where I wrote short reviews of books I'd enjoyed. As I prepare for graduate school, I'm excited to announce I'm reviving this concept with a new twist: hashtag#ReedWrites!

Throughout my graduate journey, I'll be publishing articles on topics I'm exploring to reinforce my learning and sharpen my technical communication skills.

Today, I'm thrilled to share my first piece: "Electron 101: Building Cross-Platform Desktop Apps with Web Technologies"!

This article stems from my exploration of "local first" development as a cost-effective approach to building product MVPs. When I discovered that companies like VSCode, Slack, and Notion all leverage Electron for their cross-platform applications, I knew I had found my first topic!

In the article, I break down:
- What makes Electron unique in the app development landscape
- The multi-process architecture that powers cross-platform compatibility
- How inter-process communication works
- Environment variable management across processes
- Real code examples to get you started

I'm excited to share this learning journey with you! Your insights/feedback would be invaluable - whether you drop a comment, send a DM, or contribute directly with a PR. Let's build!
